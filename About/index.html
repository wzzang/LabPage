		<h5>
			<p>Welcome to the Imaging of Brain Health (IBH) Lab!</p>
			<p class="mb-2">
				The IBH Lab, led by <a href="https://cla.auburn.edu/directory/wei-zhang/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Wei Zhang</a>, Assistant Professor of Psychological Sciences at Auburn University, studies how the brain develops, adapts, and supports resilience across the lifespan. 
				Using advanced neuroimaging and a multidisciplinary approach, we explore the biological and environmental factors that shape brain and mental health, with the ultimate goal of uncovering mechanisms to guide interventions that promote resilience and well-being.

		<!-- <h2 style="font-size: 2em;">Our Research Interests:</h2>		
		<ul>
		<li>How neurobiological systems (e.g., inflammation, hormones, metabolism) relate to mental health</li>
		<li>How life transitions (e.g., puberty, menopause, aging) affect brain function and resilience</li>
		<li>How early-life and environmental experiences interact with biology to shape lifelong brain health</li>
		<li>How can we better predict, prevent, or intervene in emerging mental health risks</li>
		</ul> -->


			<p class="mb-3">
			Our lab values team science and cross-disciplinary collaboration, innovation in methods and ideas, inclusive and curiosity-driven research, and mentorship and career development at all stages. We believe diverse perspectives and open scientific inquiry are essential for advancing our understanding of the human brain.
